# The SOC and it's Role
- SOC is short for `Security Operation Center` , and it's a centralized unit within an organization that deals with security issues, incidents and events .
### ***Stages of security operations***
1. **Monitoring** :  observing the company's system and networks and digital assets for any suspicious activity, and so we use monitoring tools : `IDS, SIEM etc.` for real time visibility into things like log data. It also enables us to early detect potential security threats .
2. **Detection** :  We utilize threat detection techniques to identify indicators of compromise `IOCs` .
3. **Analyzing** :  Analyst conduct in depth investigations to understand the scope of the incidents, examine affected systems and build timeline of events .
4. **Responding** :  Analyst need to formulate a response plan based on their findings .

### *What makes up a SOC*
- Every SOC is equipped with `Personals`, `Protocols` and `Technical resources` 
	- `Personals = People` > Analysts, responders, engineers etc.
	- `Protocls = Processes` > IR plans, playbooks etc.
	- `Technical resources = Technology` > SIEM, IDS, EDR etc.

### *CIA Triad*
- The SOC aims to ensure `C : Confidentiality` , `I : Integrity` and `A : Availability` of all assets within an organization .

### ***Functions of a SOC***
1. ***Reactive*** :
	- *Monitoring and Detection* : Logs, alerts, using SIEM, IDS ...
	- *Incident Response* : Investigate, contain and mitigate threats, collect evidence, engage with stakeholders ...
	- *Forensic Analysis* : Determining cause and scope, preserve evidence and engage legal
	- *Malware Analysis* : Sandbox and reverse engineering malware, and collect indicators of compromise to improve our detection tools etc.
2. ***Proactive*** :
	- *Threat Intelligence* : Gather and analyze and study intelligence to improve our detection tools 
	- *Threat Hunting* : Search for malicious activity or intrusions
	- *Vulnerability Management* : Identify and address vulnerabilities, so we scan and assess vulnerabilities 
	- *Security Awareness Training* : Promote security awareness within the organization, and mitigate human error etc.


# *Information Security Refresher*
## **CIA Triad**
1. `Confidentiality` : Protection of sensitive info form unauthorized access 
2. `Integrity` : Ensures the data remains accurate, reliable, and consistent
3. `Availability` :  Ensures that data and resources are accessible and usable when needed

## **AAA Framework** 
1. `Authentication`  : Are the user is really who they claim they are, we use passwords, keys etc.
2. `Authorization`  :  What permissions the user have access to
3. `Accounting`  :  Tracking and recording activities within a system

### ***Vulnerability***
- Weaknesses in systems, networks and processes
- Can be exploited by threats to compromise CIA
- Exposes the organization to ***Threats***
### ***Threat***
- Any potential danger to information or systems
- Takes advantage of a ***vulnerability***
### ***Risk***
- Likelihood of a *threat* exploiting a *vulnerability*
- Potential for loss and damage when a *threat* occurs
## ***Log***
- A record of events or actions that have occurred within a system
- Used for monitoring and troubleshooting security incidents
### ***Security Event***
- Any observable occurrence that has a potential significance for security : A failed login attempt etc.
- All incidents are events, but not all events are incidents
## ***Security Incident***
- An occurrence that actually harms or jeopardizes information or systems
- Constitutes a violation of law, security policies, procedures or acceptable use
### ***Alert***
- A notification generated by security systems or personnel
- Indication of a potential security issue or suspicious activity

## **Security Controls**
- When we install security controls that work with each other we aim to achieve what's called : `Defense in Depth`
	- It's a strategy that involves layering multiple security and access control layers to protect against threats and vulnerabilities
- `Administrative Controls` : These are the policies and guidelines that are used to manage and mitigate security risk
- `Technical Controls` : Firewalls, EDR, antivirus etc.
- `Physical Controls` :  These are the stuff used to protect the physical elements of the environment where infrastructure operates
### *Security Control Functions*
1. `Preventive Control` : Eliminate or reduce likelihood of an attack succeeding (ACLs, EDR, IPS ...)
2. `Detective Control` : Identify and record attempted or successful intrusions (IDS, SIEM, logs, surveillance cameras ...)
3. `Corrective Control` : Eliminate or reduce the impact of an intrusion using backups, IR plans ...
4. `Deterrent Control` : Discouraging intrusion attempts (physical barriers, signage ...)
5. `Compensating Control` : Acts as an alternative means for a principal control (network segmentation, data masking ...)

## **Risk Control Strategies** 
- `Risk Transference` : Shifting responsibility to a third-party
- `Risk Acceptence` : Acknowledge and tolerate a risk (e.g. When the losses from having a risk are less than the fix)
- `Risk Avoidance` : Proactively eliminate or avoid exposure to a risk
- `Risk Mitigation` : Reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk (implementing a patch management ...)

## Security Policies
- Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) :
	- What is and isn't allowed
	- Bring your own device (BYOD)
- Password Policy : 
	- Specific requirements for creating and managing passwords
	- Complexity, length, expiration and reuse
- Data Classification Policy : 
	- Categorize data based on sensitivity and importance
	- How to handle data at each level
- Change Management Policy :
	- Planning and implementing changes to any IT systems or processes
- Disaster Recovery Policy : 
	- Recovering IT systems and data
	- Natural disaster, cyber attacks, etc.


# ***SOC Models***
## **Internal SOC**
- Owned and operated by the organization it serves
- Monitors and defends internal networks, systems and data
- Requires significant upfront investment in training and resources
## **Managed SOC (MSOC)**
- Third-party provider of security operations
- Basic monitoring or comprehensive threat detection and response
- Subscription-based SLAs, more cost-effective
## **Hybrid SOC**
- Elements of internal and managed SOC services
- IR, Forensic analysis, malware analysis
- Flexible compromise - call in the experts as needed

# ***SOC Roles***

# ***Event Management***
- It's the process of monitoring, analyzing and prioritizing generous events made by our systems 
- The goal is to continually collect and accurate record of all the happenings across our environment which gives us a strong visibility of our infrastructure
# ***Incident Management***
- The process of detecting and resolving security incidents in a timely effective manner to minimize their impact, it follows pretty defined paths :
	- `Incident Identification` : Event management escalation
	- `Incident Classification` : Severity, impact and nature
	- `Incident Investigation` : Gather evidence
	- `Incident Containment` : Prevent further escalation
	- `Incident Eradication` : Remove the evil
	- `Incident Recovery` : Restoring normal business operations

# ***Detection Outcomes***
- `False Positive` : Incorrect identification of benign activity
- `True Positive` : Correct identification of a real incident
- `False Negative` : Failing detection of a real threat
- `True Negative` : Correct identification of benign activity
# **SOC Metrics**
- `Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)` : Lower MTTD = Faster detection
- `Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)` : Lower MTTR = More efficient IR
	- It's also called `Mean Time To Respond`, Both are correct, but "Resolution" implies the whole threat is gone (Eradication), while "Response" sometimes just means the initial action was taken. 
- `Mean Time To Attend and Analyze (MTTA&A)` : Lower MTTA&A = reduced response latency
- `Incident Detection Rate` : Higher rate = Better visibility and monitoring
- `False Positive Rates (FPR)` : Lower rate = More accurate Detection
- `False Negative Rates (FNR)` : Lower rate = More accurate detection
